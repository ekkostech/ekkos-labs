## The Principles

### 1. Memory Is Structure

Memory is not storage. It is the structured representation of experience.

### 2. Learning Is Evolution

Learning is not accumulation. It is the evolution of strategies through experience.

### 3. Intelligence Is Reflection

Intelligence is not computation. It is the capacity to reflect on experience and improve.

### 4. Safety Is Foundation

Safety is not an add-on. It is built into every layer of the architecture.

### 5. Privacy Is Architecture

Privacy is not a feature. It is enforced at the architectural level.

---

## The Promise

We promise to build **the cognitive operating system** that every intelligent system needs.

We promise to:
- **Capture** every echo of experience
- **Structure** every pattern of intelligence
- **Evolve** every strategy of learning
- **Reflect** on every process of improvement
- **Protect** every system with safety

We promise to build for the AGI era.
