# Pattern Evolution Design
## Autonomous Strategy Improvement

**Status:** Planned Document  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Episode linking (for pattern genealogy)

---

## Overview

This document will define the design for pattern evolution—enabling patterns to mutate, merge, and refine autonomously based on outcomes.

---

## Planned Sections

### 1. Problem Statement
- Why static patterns limit intelligence
- Use cases for pattern evolution
- Impact on pattern success rates

### 2. Evolution Mechanisms
- Pattern mutation (small changes)
- Pattern merging (consolidate similar patterns)
- Pattern deprecation (retire ineffective patterns)
- Pattern composition (combine into workflows)

### 3. Testing Framework
- Mutation testing against historical data
- A/B testing for live patterns
- Success criteria and promotion logic
- Rollback mechanisms

### 4. Database Schema
- `pattern_versions` table
- `pattern_genealogy` table
- `pattern_mutations` table
- Version tracking

### 5. Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Mutation system
- Phase 2: Merging logic
- Phase 3: Testing framework
- Phase 4: Promotion/deprecation

### 6. Success Metrics
- Pattern success rate improvements
- Mutation success rate
- User experience improvements
