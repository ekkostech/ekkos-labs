## Version 1: Onboarding Card (One-Time)

**Title:** ekkOS is learning in the background

**Body:**
While you work, ekkOS:
- Refines patterns based on what actually works
- Keeps memory search fast as data grows
- Links related episodes so agents remember the full story
- Validates patterns and blocks unsafe strategies

No dashboards. No knobs. It just gets better over time.

**Hover Text:**
> ekkOS continuously improves patterns, keeps memory fast, and remembers context across sessions—all automatically.

**Click Text (Expanded):**
> **How ekkOS improves:**
> - Patterns get better over time (60% → 85% success rates)
> - Memory stays fast as data grows (150ms consistently)
> - Agents remember full context (75% less re-explaining)
> - System maintains itself (0 hours manual work)

**Placement:** Dashboard footer, near ekkOS branding

**No configuration required.** It just works.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Show

- **Onboarding:** Version 1 (one-time card)
- **Feature Launch:** Version 4 (status banner) or Version 5 (modal)
- **Persistent Info:** Version 2 (tooltip) or Version 3 (docs section)
- **Contextual Help:** Version 6 (inline help)

### Tone

- **Confident but not boastful** — "It just works" not "Revolutionary breakthrough"
- **Specific not vague** — "60% → 85%" not "gets better"
- **User-focused** — "What you feel" not "What we built"

### Design Notes

- **Keep it short** — 3-4 bullet points max
- **Use metrics** — Numbers make it concrete
- **No jargon** — "Patterns improve" not "Pattern evolution system"
- **Visual hierarchy** — Bold key metrics, light supporting text
